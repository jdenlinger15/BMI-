BMI = kg/m*m
meter = inch *(0.0254/1)
inch = meter *(1inch/0.0254meter)
feet = their input
inches = their input
inches = their input

//keyboard = new Scanner (System.in);
System.out.println("What is your height (only feet)?")
feet = their input
System.out.println("What is your height (only inches)?")
inches = their input
inches = inches + (feet * 12)
